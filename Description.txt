The scorekeeper app that I have created using simple JavaScript, HTML, and Bulma CSS framework allows two players to keep track of their scores while playing Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The app has a user-friendly interface that displays the current scores of both players, as well as the options to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors for each turn. Once a player selects an option, the app will determine the winner of that round and update the scores accordingly. The app also has a reset button that allows the players to start a new game from scratch. Overall, the scorekeeper app provides an easy and efficient way for players to keep track of their scores while enjoying the game.
